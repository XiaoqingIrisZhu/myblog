# British Museum Blog

The British Museum is one of the four largest museums in the world. It has many rare collections. On its official website, there is a lot of information to explore. The search bar also enables visitors to find their favorite collections in a short period of time. Although people are less likely to travel because of the COVID-19, the British Museum has launched an online tour, allowing people to visit at home.

The British Museum's online 3D technology enables visitors to look at the collection in all directions and in detail, as well as zoom in and out. My favorite work is the collage of flowers which made by **Mary Delany**, a British artist. Her works are very beautiful and show the color of flowers in innovative ways.

In addition, I found that the British Museum has a Chinese website, but there is no other language. Brochure also only provides English, Chinese and Japanese. I believe that if more languages are added, visitors will feel more convenient and can browse better.
